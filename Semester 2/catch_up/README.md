# Catch-Up Pack — For New Students

Self-guided scripts for someone joining mid-semester with no programming experience. Each file teaches one concept, takes ~10 minutes, and has a "Your Turn" challenge at the bottom.

## How to Use This
1. Sit the new student beside a reliable kid who can help with small things (typos, where the run button is, etc.)
2. Point them at file `01_hello.py` and say "read the green comments, then press run"
3. Check in every ~10 minutes to see where they are and answer questions
4. They don't need to finish all 6 in one session — even getting through 1-4 is solid progress

## The Files (in order)

| # | File | What It Teaches | They'll Learn |
|---|------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | `01_hello.py` | print, variables, input | How to show text and ask questions |
| 2 | `02_numbers.py` | int(), maths operators | How to do maths (and why int() matters) |
| 3 | `03_decisions.py` | if / elif / else | How to make Python choose |
| 4 | `04_loops.py` | for loops, while loops | How to repeat things |
| 5 | `05_lists.py` | lists, append, looping through lists | How to store multiple things |
| 6 | `06_mini_quiz.py` | Puts it all together | A real program using everything |

## When Are They Ready to Join the Main Class?
- After **files 1-4**: They can follow along with most group exercises (with support)
- After **files 1-5**: They can attempt individual exercises
- After **file 6**: They're caught up on the basics and ready to learn functions with the group

## Tips
- If they fly through 1-3 quickly, they're probably a fast learner — let them try jumping to the mini quiz (file 6) and see if they can follow it
- If they're slow on file 1, that's fine — spend the session just on files 1 and 2. The "Your Turn" challenges are more important than rushing through all 6
- The "Your Turn" sections are the real test. If they can do those without help, they understand the concept
