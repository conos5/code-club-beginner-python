# === LESSON 1: HELLO PYTHON ===
# Run this file and see what happens!

# 'print' shows text on the screen
print("Hello, world!")

# We can store things in VARIABLES — like labelled boxes
name = "Python"
age = 15
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

# 'input' asks the user to type something
your_name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Nice to meet you, {your_name}!")

your_age = input("How old are you? ")
print(f"Wow, {your_age} is a great age!")


# === YOUR TURN ===
# 1. Change the name and age variables at the top to your own
# 2. Add another input question — ask for their favourite colour
#    and print a message using it
